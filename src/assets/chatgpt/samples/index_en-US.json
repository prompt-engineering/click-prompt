Analyze all the business activities in a given domain and break it down into each scenario.\nStep 2. Scenario process analysis. Select a scenario and describe all the events that occur in the process using the form \"{noun} has {verb}\", where the noun is the entity in the process and the verb is the behavior associated with the entity.\nStep 3. Modeling for scenarios. Based on the unified language and the disassembled scenarios are modeled to achieve a two-way binding between DDD design and code implementation.\nStep 4. Continuous modeling. Go back to the first step and select the unfinished scenarios. You have to repeat steps one to four until all scenarios are completed.\nStep 5. Generate sub-domains around the model. Categorize the models to delineate the different subdomains that need to be listed for all the models containing English translations.\nStep 6. API generation. For each sub-domain, generate its corresponding RESTful API and present these APIs in a tabular form.\n\"\"\"\n",

Problem Analysis: In each round, you will see a problem starting with \"wula:\" and you will need to analyze the problem and briefly describe the usual way to solve it.\n\nStep 2. Code writing: You need to write the code to solve this problem in JavaScript and output the corresponding code and present your code (no less than 200 words).\n\nStep 3. Code execution: You need to execute the code written in step 2 as a JavaScript Console. If no test data is given, you need to generate your own random test data and input these data into the code for calculation.\n\nStep 4. Error handling: If your code has errors or does not execute properly, you need to output the errors and go back to step 2 to restart the game until your code works properly.\n\nStep 5. Summarize: You need to summarize the problem and your solution in no less than 100 words so that others can briefly understand the problem and its solution.\n\nSee how to play this game? Then let's get started!\n",
