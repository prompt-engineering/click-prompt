      No

      Describe the solution you'd like
      I would like to be able to use ChatGPT to automatically create GitHub issues from within ClickPrompt. This would help community contributors better understand the requirements and goals of a given feature request.

      Describe alternatives you've considered
      Manually creating GitHub issues is a time-consuming process, and it can be difficult to ensure that all relevant information is included. By automating this process with ChatGPT, we can save time and improve the overall quality of the issues we create.

      - ClickPrompt is a tool designed for Prompt writers that supports a variety of Prompt-based AI applications, such as Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot. With ClickPrompt, you can easily view, share, and run these models with one click, while providing an online Prompt generator that allows users to easily create compliant Prompt based on their needs and share it with others.
      - ClickPrompt includes several page components: chatgpt, chatgpt-general, chatgpt-generator-cot, chatgpt-interactive-game, chatgpt-prompt-role-play, chatgpt- samples, chatgpt-startling-by-each-step, github-copilot-samples, resources, stable-diffusion-examples, stable-diffusion-generator
      - ClickPrompt uses Next.js, React, Chakra UI, Tailwind, etc. as the main development frameworks and Planetscale as the database.

      Now, we want you to add a new feature, namely: feature: add tour guide for ClickPrompt. the description is as follows.

      """
      """

      How should I modify it? Give a direct example?
    response: |
      To add tour guide functionality to the home page of ClickPrompt, you can use the reactour library. First, you need to install reactour:

      ```bash
      npm install reactour
      ```

      Then, in the home page code of ClickPrompt, you need to introduce the reactour component：

      ```jsx
      import Tour from 'reactour/dist/components/Tour/Tour';
      import { useTour } from 'reactour/dist/hooks/useTour';
      ```

      Next, add the Tour code to the component's JSX.:

      ```jsx
      <Provider>
        {/* https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/42292 */}
        {/* @ts-expect-error Async Server Component */}
        <NavBar locale={lang} />
        <Container maxW='8xl' p={{ md: "2rem", base: "1rem" }}>
          {children}
        </Container>
        </Provider>
        <div className='flex justify-center py-4'>
        <a
        className='flex gap-4 items-center'
        href='https://vercel.com?utm_source=prompt-engineering&utm_campaign=oss'
        target={"_blank"}

        alt='Vercel Logo'
        />
        </a>
        </div>
        <AnalyticsWrapper />
        <Tour
          steps={[
            {
              selector: '.navbar-nav > li:nth-child(1) > a',
              content: 'This is the ChatGPT section',
            },
            {
              selector: '.navbar-nav > li:nth-child(2) > a',
              content: 'This is the StableDiffusion section',
            },
            {
              selector: '.navbar-nav > li:nth-child(3) > a',
              content: 'This is the StableDiffusion Generator section',
            },
            {
              selector: '.navbar-nav > li:nth-child(4) > a',
              content: 'This is the GitHub Copilot section',
            },
            {
              selector: '.navbar-nav > li:nth-child(5) > a',
              content: 'This is the Resources section',
            },
          ]}
          isOpen={isTourOpen}
          onRequestClose={() => setIsTourOpen(false)}
        />
      ```

      In the above code, the steps property defines each step of the Tour, where selector specifies the selector of the component that needs to guide the user, and content is the explanation of the step. isOpen property controls the on/off state of the Tour, and onRequestClose property defines the callback function to close the Tour.
